<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>We built an infrastructure for optimization problems with the right amount of abstraction that would allow us to easily build new algorithms and problems independently. This way, we can swap in new algorithms or new problems without starting from scratch. Our main goal was to solve constraint programming problems, particularly the Nurse Scheduling Problem. We implemented 3 metaheuristic optimization algorithms: Cuckoo Search (CS), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and a hybrid of the two algorithms. These algorithms can of course also solve more basic problems. We included four mathematical optimization test functions and three simple real-world problems in addition to the nurse scheduling problem to demonstrate the flexibility of our design as well as analyze the performance of the 3 algorithms.</p>

<p>The first algorithm, called the Cuckoo Search, is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm based on the behavior of the cuckoo bird (<strong>Reference</strong>). Some cuckoo species parasitically lay their eggs in the nest of another bird species. If the host bird recognizes this egg as alien, it will throw it away or abandon the nest entirely. If, however, the cuckoo successfully mimicked the egg of the host species, the host bird will raise the egg as its own. In this algorithm, an initial set of nests, or solutions, are randomly generated. These solutions are then updated over multiple generations. The process of updating an individual solution is as follows: a random nest is chosen, and a new solution is generated by random-walking from this previous solution. This new solution can then replace a different randomly chosen solution if it has a fitness better than the original. After this possible replacement of a solution, all of the nests are ranked by fitness and the worst fraction of the nests are replaced with random solutions. This combination of mechanisms allow the solutions to search locally and globally at the same time for the optimal solution.</p>

<p>The second algorithm, called the Particle Swarm Optimization, is a relatively popular algorithm introduced in 1995, and based on the social behavior of a swarm. Each particle, which represents a solution, has a velocity that allows the particle to move around the search space. Over each generation, the particle’s position is updated using its velocity, which is biased towards the particle’s own best position and the globally best position. This mechanism of swarm intelligence is expected to move the entire swarm towards the best solutions.</p>

<p>The last algorithm is a hybrid of the above two algorithms that combines all the above mechanisms in each iteration. First, a new solution is generated using the random walk which may replace another solution. Next, every solution is updated using the associated velocities as described above. Finally, the worst fraction of nests are replaced with random solutions.</p>

<p>In addition, we built a website as the graphical user interface for our project. Originally a terminal UI, it was agreed upon that a website was both more interactive and more descriptive. <a href="http://optimizer.nickmerrill.me">Here</a> you can select a problem, read all about it, enter your desired inputs, and choose an algorithm with which to solve.</p>

<h2 id="planning">Planning</h2>

<p>Three weeks ago, we set out to write an optimization algorithm. The end goal was to be able to handle real-world problems as complex as the nurse scheduling problem and still find an optimal solution. That goal has been met. <strong>WOOT!</strong></p>

# Optimizer Frontend

This is the Django HTML frontend for the [optimization algorithms](https://github.com/NicholasMerrill/Optimizer).

## A Few Thoughts

This is intended to demonstrate the algorithms in a more intuitive way than simple command-line entry. Our future features were to include:

* uploading CSV files to specify preferences for the Nurse Scheduling Problem
* visualization
  * visualization of final solution sets (the top several solutions) -- to indicate the existence of several local solutions
  * live visualization of solutions as they are generated
